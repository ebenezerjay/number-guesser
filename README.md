# Number Guesser
### By Antonio Fry and Ebenezer Ingalsbe
## Intro
The Number Guesser was a project that was assigned by Turing, and is a demonstration of Javascript at a early level. The main sites actual function relies on two user being present, and for the them to set a range between two numbers. Once the numbers have been set, the site will run some Javascript that randomly picks a number within that range. From there it is up to the users to compete to guess the number. After each turn the site will either prompt the user saying their guess 'was too high' or ' too low', or will display the winner on a card on the right.

## Work Comp
Even though one of the main focuses of the site was creating functioning Javascript, the css and html was completely based off this comp for the desktop:

This image below was the comp for the mobile version:
